## A Winamp Module like no other


</div>

### Description

I was looking for a winamp code that went beyong the normal play, pause, and stop functions. When I couldn't find it, i made it myself. This is the best winamp module on planetsourcecode, it does more than just play and stop, it can get song length, get song position, set the song position, get the status of winamp, allows you to do just about everything winamp can do. You don't want to miss this code if your looking for code to work with winamp, for plugins or for anything. It's extremely easy to use too, even novice programmers will be able to understand.
